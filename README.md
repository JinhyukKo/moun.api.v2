## 1. Project Overview
Moun API V2 is a backend service powering a music auction and sales platform. It enables users to bid on and purchase unique music assets. Designed with Domain-Driven Design (DDD), the API ensures a robust, scalable, and maintainable architecture.

- **Music Auctions**: Create and manage auctions with real-time bidding.  
- **User Management**: Authentication and profile handling.  
- **Payment Integration**: Secure payment processing for purchases.  
- **Notification System**: Alerts for bidding updates and auction results.  

---

## 3. Architecture
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: Emphasizes modularity and separation of business logic.  
- **Layered Architecture**: Divided into Application, Domain, and Infrastructure layers.  
- **Microservice Ready**: Flexible enough for future modularization.  

---

## 4. Technology Stack
- **Language**: Java (or .NET, based on your stack)  
- **Framework**: Spring Boot (or ASP.NET Core)  
- **Database**: MySQL/PostgreSQL with an ORM (Hibernate/EF Core)  
- **Authentication**: JWT-based security  
- **Deployment**: Docker and CI/CD pipelines  

---

## 5. Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Implementation
- **Core Domains**:
  - *Auctions*: Bidding, auction creation, and status tracking.  
  - *Users*: Registration, authentication, and profiles.  
  - *Payments*: Payment processing and status updates.  
- **Aggregates and Entities**: Central objects encapsulating logic.  
- **Repositories**: Persistent storage abstractions.
